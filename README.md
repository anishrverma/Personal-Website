# Personal Website 

The website resulting from this work is found here at **[anishrverma.github.io](https://anishrverma.github.io/)** .

This wenbiste is built off of `react-js` library of `javascript`, and thus requires `node.js` and `npm`.

If you clone this locally, `npm start` should open the website on your browser.

In `src/portfolio.js` you can input your own information.

## Deployment

Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder, and push the build folder to a repository with the website name, if you want to deploy using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)):**
