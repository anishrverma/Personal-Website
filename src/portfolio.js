        "As more attention is brought to the issue of racial injustice, public sentiments and opinions on racial issues are increasingly important to track. At the same time, recent progress in machine learning and natural language processing methods, coupled with the growing amount of available data for training and analysis, allows researchers to extract sentiments from text data at large scales. We applied a natural language processing framework to study public sentiment surrounding the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Specifically, we used a state-of-the-art BERT model fine-tuned for Twitter sentiment classification to predict the sentiment from approximately 1 million tweets from July 2013 to March 2021 related to BLM. The BERT model was trained on the Sentiment 140 dataset on which it obtained an AUC of 0.97 on the training data and 0.94 on testing data, outperforming other machine learning models. We found that retweet frequency and word count frequency were able to illustrate important themes in the BLM movement as well as indicate events of significant importance to the movement. Additionally, sentiment analysis revealed which of these themes and events were associated with positive public sentiment, such as social justice, and which were associated with negative sentiment, such as police brutality. Our analyses can also be applied to better understand other social and political movements to aid related research and activism.",

        "The COVID-19 infodemic, described as an overabundance of both accurate and inaccurate information, poses a significant public health risk in spreading fear and provoking inappropriate prescription. The overwhelming and often contradictory information on as potential treatments for COVID-19 have contributed to this infodemic. Public sources including the US federal government, health organizations, and research publications have released conflicting statements on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Previous research has not analyzed the influence of these sources on public attitudes and conversation towards the drug. To evaluate this impact, changes in the number and sentiment of tweets tagged with the hashtag or keyword ‚Äúhydroxychloroquine‚Äù from March 12th to June 22nd, 2020 in relation to public sources were analyzed. We found that the US government had a statistically significant influence on public attitudes and behaviour (p < 0.001), unlike health organizations and research publications. Public sentiment on hydroxychloroquine has also been observed to become more negative over time, suggesting that public attitudes towards controversial topics can change. This study also found a positive correlation between public sentiment of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs (i.e. azithromycin and remdesivir) which indicates that public sources disseminating hydroxychloroquine-related information could also affect public attitudes towards related treatments. In a public health crisis, all statements and actions from public sources regarding contentious topics like hydroxychloroquine should be made with caution. To mitigate the disproportionate influence of public sources in an infodemic, we recommend three solutions: (a) education to empower individuals of all ages to develop critical thinking and digital literacy skills; (b) stronger action from social media platforms in labeling misinformation; (c) and cooperation between entities with strong influence (e.g. federal government) and other sources for public health measures. Together, these recommendations could resolve shortcomings existent with a single approach. Future research should be conducted with a custom trained model for sentiment analysis. It would also be valuable to conduct a similar version of the study on other social media platforms as well as for public health issues beyond COVID-19.",

        "The CME Market Sentiment Meter (MSM) calculates market sentiment states based on a novel mixture distribution, taking input from options and futures settlement data. We compare market sentiment from financial data to text sentiment from sentiment analysis as an indicator for market trends due to external events. Both types of sentiment were explored in a case study of the year 2020 about the US Treasury 10-Year Note futures (TYF). The year brought large fluctuations in the US economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other major events. The standard deviation of MSM mixture distribution has shifted earlier than the polarity score found through sentiment analysis. The movement in the MSM mixture distribution standard deviation preceded a price movement in the most active settlement price of the TYF.",

As the cold wave became more severe, the MSM indicated Anxious states, which preceded an upward movement in settlement price. During and following the price spike, the MSM indicated Balanced states.

GC consistently fell once the rate hikes were announced. The year 2019 saw slowed economic growth and increased tensions with China, Iran, and Russia. This led to a large rise in GC from July to November. GC remained at a high relative to the beginning of the year. In 2019, the Federal Reserve made 3 rate cuts.

        "The COVID-19 pandemic had a notable effect on the eight futures and options products tracked by 1QBit‚Äôs CME Market Sentiment Meter. In some markets, such as U.S. equity index futures and U.S. interest rate futures, there were rapid increases in daily futures volumes as prices changed, and traders managed their evolving risk. The peaks in daily volume were followed by diminishments that varied from market to market, as well as changes in the volumes and positions observed in the corresponding options markets. The CME Market Sentiment Meter reported transitions from the Balanced state to the Anxious state in all products except soybeans and natural gas. The Anxious state is associated with an expectation of larger price movements, which were observed in the markets. In addition, it was seen that forward-looking activity moved from futures to options at a different rate for each product, and that market sentimentstook time to become established.",

During this period, the Market Sentiment Meter (MSM) indicated Balanced market states. Following a period of Conflicted market states in May, CL fell from 63.21 USD/bbl to 51.14 USD/bbl. The market state became Anxious and CL began to rise. In August, the prospect of trade talks diminished and the market state was Balanced. The MSM indicated that the market state remained Balanced for the rest of the 2019. On September 14th 2019, there was a drone attack on the Saudi Aramco facilities located in Abqaiq and Khurais, Saudi Arabia. There was a rise in CL from 54.85 USD/bbl to 62.9 USD/bbl. The market state was Balanced prior to the attack. The risk-return curve became skewed immediately after the attack. However, the market state remained Balanced.

        "In 1937, Hermann Jahn and Edward Teller published their research describing a mechanism of symmetry breaking in nonlinear polyatomic molecules resulting in a lifting of orbital degeneracy of an electronic state, yielding insight into molecular structure. The impact of symmetry breaking on the energy and structure of quantum states is not unique to molecules and may be applied to nuclei, involving degenerate nucleon states as opposed to electronic states. Reinhard and Otten showed that the nuclear Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect provides a mechanism applicable to describe the commonly observed collective quadrupole surface motion. To take into account single-particle effects, it is important to properly model the valence nucleons, especially those occupying large angular momenta orbitals near the Fermi level. In this work, a model has been developed in which two valence nucleons of the same kind are coupled to an axially symmetric quadrupole deformed rotor of the D2 symmetry and interact through the nuclear delta force. To test this model, the band of the lowest-energy state at a given spin for 126Ce is reproduced. The resultant wavefunctions are then used to calculate the g factor, reduced electric quadrupole transition probability, and spectroscopic quadrupole moment all as a function of spin. This method lays the groundwork to explore higher order symmetries following the multipole expansion.",
